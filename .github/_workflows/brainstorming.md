# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Use this workflow before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior.

## Step 1: Understand Current Context
- Review project files, documentation, and recent commits
- Identify existing patterns and constraints

## Step 2: Refine Through Questions
- Ask questions ONE AT A TIME to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice when possible
- Focus on: purpose, constraints, success criteria
- If a topic needs more exploration, break into multiple questions

## Step 3: Explore Approaches
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Lead with your recommended option and explain WHY
- Present options conversationally with reasoning

## Step 4: Present Design Incrementally
- Break design into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify

## Step 5: Document the Design
- Write validated design to implementation_plan.md artifact
- Use the implementation_plan artifact structure
- Request user review via notify_user

## Key Principles
- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches
- **Incremental validation** - Present in sections, validate each
