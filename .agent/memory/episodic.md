# Episodic Memory: STAC Manager Project

[ID: INITIAL_MEMORY_INIT] -> Follows [NONE]. 
**Date**: 2026-01-22
**Context**: Initializing persistent memory store for STAC Manager development.
**Events**:
- Created high-level implementation roadmap for STAC Manager (Phases 1-3).
- Designed and saved optimized prompts for generating and executing toolkit implementation plans (`generate-implementation-plan.md`, `execute-implementation-plan.md`).
- Established the `agent-memory` skill to maintain context across sessions.
- Integrated TDD and YAGNI into the core planning workflow.
[ID: PHASE_1_UTILITIES_DESIGN] -> Follows [INITIAL_MEMORY_INIT]. 
**Date**: 2026-01-22
**Context**: Completed design and implementation planning for STAC Manager Utilities (Phase 1).
**Events**:
- Defined "STAC Manager Utilities" as the foundational domain-driven modules (`utils/`).
- Established "Three-Tier Error Handling" (Fail Fast, Step Out, Graceful Degradation).
- Validated "Approach A" (Domain-Driven Modules) over functional or OO patterns.
- Created a granular 18-task TDD implementation plan.
- Renamed project artifacts to correctly reflect "STAC Manager Utilities" nomenclature.
- Synchronized roadmap to show Phase 1 dependencies.
